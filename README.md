I am working on a web app project to handle my collection of downloaded movies and series, you can find it
here: [The Movie Shelf](https://github.com/mdaubie/movie-shelf)

This is a personal project for my needs, so it probably won't be interesting for you (I might actually keep it private),
but I need to develop some libraries for this main project which might be useful to you:
